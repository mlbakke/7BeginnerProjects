Beginner practice excercises taken from https://medium.com/@avicndugu/projects-to-practice-html-css-skills-for-beginners-8b9ed67a7dd1.

<h2>First project: Tribute page</h2>
Super simple website with header, footer, an image box and a timeline. 
First project I've finished in this series and consists solely of HTML and CSS.

<h2>Second project: Survey Form</h2>
A simple survey form page with a header, footer, background and the form itself.
Everything is a little more styled than what I did on the Tribute Page. 
Consists of HTML, CSS, and some simple JavaScript added to make the header 
smaller when scrolled down on the page.

<h2>Third project: Product Landing Page</h2>
A Product page consisting of several different sections. Responsive layout, 
a header, footer, navigation, simple email form, features section, video section,
and a section for three different offers. 
Consists solely of HTML and CSS.

<h2>More to come</h2>
